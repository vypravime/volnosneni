    compLink:
      name: compLink
      container: true
      description: |-
        **Like classic `<<link>>` macro, but INSIDE OUT:**

        `<<link "Anchor text">>`Code to be done after click`<</link>>`
        
        ||

        ```
        <<compLink "CODE TO BE DONE AFTER CLICK">>ANCHOR TEXT<</compLink>>
        ```
        *(useful for highly computed achor texts)*
    dialogCloseButton:
      name: dialogCloseButton
      description: |-
        **Shows button closing dialog window.**
        
        Usage:
        ```
        <<dialogCloseButton "TextOnButton" [omit outer <p>?]>>
        ```
        *(If the second argument /default is FALSE/ is set to TRUE,
          then the enclosing paragraph around the button is ommited.)*
    passageDialog:
      name: passageDialog
      description: |-
        **Opens given Passage in Dialog window.**
        
        Usage:
        ```
        <<passageDialog "Dialog Heading" "passageName">>
        ```
        *(If there was already opened another dialog window,
          it will close it at first
          before opening the new passage dialog window.
          It seems prettier)*
